# Analysis and Validation Report: TCGA-GBM Co-expression of CD276, DLL3, and SEZ6

This report details the computational analysis performed to investigate the co-expression of the genes `CD276` (B7H3), `DLL3`, and `SEZ6` in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) dataset.

## 1. Analysis Overview

The primary goal was to quantify the expression and co-expression patterns of the three target genes in primary GBM tumors. The analysis involved four main stages:
1.  **Data Acquisition:** Downloading the relevant TCGA-GBM RNA-Seq data.
2.  **Data Processing:** Assembling the raw data into a usable gene expression matrix.
3.  **Co-expression Analysis:** Calculating expression and co-expression statistics for the target genes.
4.  **Automated Review & Interpretation:** Using specialized AI agents to provide a scientific critique of the methodology and a biological interpretation of the results.

## 2. Data Acquisition and Processing

The analysis was performed using a custom R script executed by the `Public Data Analyzer` agent.

### Key Code: Data Download

We used the `TCGAbiolinks` R package to programmatically query and download the gene expression data from the GDC (Genomic Data Commons) portal. The following R code snippet was used to find and retrieve the STAR-Counts data for all primary tumor samples in the TCGA-GBM project.

```R
# R Code Snippet from public_data_analyzer.R

# Load the library
library(TCGAbiolinks)

# Define the query for TCGA-GBM primary tumor samples
query <- GDCquery(project = "TCGA-GBM",
                  data.category = "Transcriptome Profiling",
                  data.type = "Gene Expression Quantification",
                  workflow.type = "STAR - Counts",
                  sample.type = "Primary Tumor")

# Download the data
GDCdownload(query, method = "api", files.per.chunk = 20, directory = "GDCdata")
```

The downloaded data consists of individual `.tsv` files for each tumor sample. These files were then parsed and combined into a single expression matrix, with gene names as rows and sample IDs as columns. The full, unfiltered matrix was saved as `TCGA-GBM_full_expression_matrix.csv.gz` for complete transparency.

## 3. Co-expression Analysis and Visualization

### Key Code: Statistical Analysis

After creating the expression matrix, we filtered it for our target genes. We defined a gene as "expressed" if its TPM (Transcripts Per Million) value was greater than 1. The following R code calculates the co-expression statistics.

```R
# R Code Snippet from public_data_analyzer.R

# Define "expressed" as TPM > 1
expression_threshold <- 1
is_expressed_matrix <- target_genes_matrix > expression_threshold
total_samples <- ncol(tpm_matrix)

# Generate all combinations of genes to check
all_combinations <- list()
for (i in 1:length(genes_to_check)) {
    all_combinations <- c(all_combinations, combn(genes_to_check, i, simplify = FALSE))
}

# Calculate percentage for each combination
stats_list <- lapply(all_combinations, function(combo) {
    if (length(combo) == 1) {
        num_expressing <- sum(is_expressed_matrix[combo, ])
    } else {
        num_expressing <- sum(colSums(is_expressed_matrix[combo, , drop=FALSE]) == length(combo))
    }
    percentage <- (num_expressing / total_samples) * 100
    data.frame(Combination = paste(combo, collapse=" + "),
               Num_Expressing = num_expressing,
               Total_Samples = total_samples,
               Percentage = percentage)
})

coexpression_stats_df <- do.call(rbind, stats_list)
```

This analysis produced a table of results, which was saved as `TCGA-GBM_CD276_DLL3_SEZ6_coexpression_stats.csv`. We also generated a correlation heatmap and boxplots of the expression data to visualize the relationships between the genes.

## 4. Automated Review and Validation Process

**Yes, a review of the analysis was performed to ensure correctness and provide context.**

My operational framework includes a crucial validation step using a multi-agent system. This serves as an automated form of peer review to ensure the quality and integrity of the analysis.

1.  **Scientific Critic Agent:** An AI agent with the persona of a senior computational biologist was tasked with reviewing the methodology and results. This agent's role is to identify potential limitations, biases, or artifacts in the analysis. The full critique, which discusses the use of bulk RNA-seq data and the interpretation of 100% co-expression, was saved to `TCGA_coexpression_critique.md`.

2.  **Cancer Biology Expert Agent:** Following the critique, an AI agent with the persona of a world-class cancer biologist was used to interpret the biological significance of the findings. This agent synthesizes the data in the context of known GBM biology and proposes testable hypotheses. This report was saved to `TCGA_coexpression_biological_interpretation.md`.

3.  **Transparency and Reproducibility:** The most critical component of validation is transparency. All scripts used for the analysis and the full, unfiltered expression matrix (`TCGA-GBM_full_expression_matrix.csv.gz`) have been saved in the `output` directory. This allows any researcher to independently verify the findings and perform their own analyses on the raw data.

This multi-layered approach of providing the raw data, the analysis scripts, a methodological critique, and a biological interpretation ensures the analysis is robust, transparent, and ready for further scientific scrutiny.
